Demonstrate at least 2 ways to create a comment. One should be for multiple lines.

Single line comments are those comments which are written without giving a line break or newline in python. A python comment is written by initializing the text of comment with a # and terminates when the end of line is encountered.

Example #This is a single line comment

When writing multi line comments using # symbol, we can also start multi line comments after any python statement.

#This is a multiline comment in python
#and expands to more than one line
